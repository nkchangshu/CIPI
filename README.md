# Original Data Acquisition
My MIMIC-IV database is the latest version, v2.2. By utilizing the "mimiciv_sample.sql," I can extract all patients diagnosed with cerebral infarction (stroke) in MIMIC-IV, resulting in a total of 3,847 records. My MIMIC-III database is the latest version of the CareVue subset, v1.4. Using "mimiciii_sample.sql," I can retrieve all patients diagnosed with cerebral infarction in the MIMIC-III CareVue subset, yielding a total of 662 records.
