This repository contains the code for data extraction as detailed in the article: Shu C, Zheng C and Zhang G (2024) "Exploring the utility of a latent variable as a comprehensive inflammatory prognostic index in critically ill patients with cerebral infarction."

MIMIC-IV Extraction
The dataset used is MIMIC-IV, version 2.2. The SQL script mimiciv_sample.sql is utilized to extract data on patients diagnosed with cerebral infarction, totaling 3,847 records.

MIMIC-III Extraction
For MIMIC-III, the latest CareVue subset version 1.4 is used. The mimiciii_sample.sql script enables the retrieval of diagnoses pertaining to cerebral infarction within the MIMIC-III CareVue subset, resulting in 662 records.

The scripts provided here are for replicating the data extraction process in the aforementioned article.

Please refer to the individual SQL files for the specific queries executed against the respective MIMIC databases.
